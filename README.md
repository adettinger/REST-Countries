# Fullstack evaluation Project

## How to use
PHP server requires php & php-curl to be installed.
This application was developed and tested in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

To start the server open a terminal window on unix/linux based systems and change
directory to the project root. Then execute this command:

```
  ./server
```

The command assumes you have a PHP & PHP-CURL binary in your system path. If you don't you
will get an error and the server will not start.

After starting the server go to:

```
http://localhost:8765/index.html  
```

Here you can use the webpage to search REST Countries API by name, fullname & code.
Statistics on your search are generated at the bottom of the page.
